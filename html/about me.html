        <p class="quote">"Die with memories not with dreams"</p>
        <p>This specific quote is my favourite because this picture of me
            holding a hockey trophy and scoring a goal in the finals makes me remember a great achievement I got and
            I had always wanted to win a trophy. I made it a reality by winning a trophy, which makes me remember
            the hard work I put in to work for it.

            currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % images.length;//In this line, the currentIndex is increased by 1, and the length of the images array is used in the coefficient operation (%). This makes sure that when the currentIndex reaches the end of the array, it wraps around to zero. It enables an endless cycle of images in the slideshow.

        changeImage();
