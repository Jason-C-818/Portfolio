    <h3>Description of Computer Science</h3>
    <p>My dream job is computer science.
        Computer scientists write code to create software programs.
        This involves in<br>initially planning the software,
        creating models and flowcharts detailing how the
        code is to be written, writing <br>and debugging code,
        and designing an application or system interface.

<div>
    <h3>Work Enviroment</h3>
    <p>Computer science often promotes an exciting, 
        cooperative, and challenging work environment. 
        There are many places <br>where computer scientists 
        can be found, such as tech companies, research 
        facilities, governmental organizations, and <br>academic 
        institutions. They frequently perform either alone or 
        collaborative work in offices. Computer science jobs
         <br>frequently require problem-solving, critical thinking, 
         and ongoing learning. Collaborating with coworkers,
          taking part <br>in brainstorming 
         sessions, and working in cross-functional teams are typical 
         activities for computer scientists.</p>
